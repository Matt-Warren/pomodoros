Tasks:
- Refactor out UI
- Save settings
    - create if not exists
    - don't crash if can't, just give up?
- Pomo Counter
- Pause/Resume with spacebar
- Add ability to create task list during break time
    - Add ability to view task list during focus time, maybe?
    - Save tasks by pomo counter/by date too
- Change increment/decrement to by 30s instead of 1m

Known Issues:
- Initial settings cause bars to look weird when you start to adjust them

Completed Ideas:
- Change from focus->break (and back) automatically
- Properly set duration (+figure out nice way to set focus vs break times)
- Refactored out App State
- Show key binds in rectangle by mode
